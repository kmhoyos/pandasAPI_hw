- As expected, temperatures rise as you get closer to the Equator.  However, it seems that they are equally as hot
within +/- 20 degrees of latitude.  Further, temperatures seem to drop more steeply further north of the Equator
than further south.  This is probably because of the lack of cities that far south and therefore lack of observable
data to plot.

- There doesn't seem to be a correlation between humidity and latitude and cloudiness and latitude.  Being closer
to the Equator doesn't effect wind or the amount of clouds.

- It also appears that there is a slight trend toward higher wind speed and distance from the Equator.  While wind
speeds of less than 15mph are common regardless of latitude, higher wind speeds, in excess of 25mph, seem to be more
common at latitudes further south than -20 degrees and further north than +40.
